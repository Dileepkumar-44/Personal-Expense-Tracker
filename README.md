# Personal Expense Tracker
Welcome to my Personal Expense Tracker, a sleek and robust web application designed to help you manage your finances effortlessly! Built with modern web technologies and optimized for performance and accessibility, this project showcases my skills as a software developer.
# Overview
This app allows users to track daily expenses, set budgets, analyze spending patterns, and switch between light/dark themes. Itâ€™s a fully responsive, offline-capable tool, with data stored locally in the browser, making it perfect for personal use. I developed this project to demonstrate my ability to build practical, user-friendly applications with a strong focus on performance optimization, web accessibility, and clean, maintainable code.
