#Technologies Used
This project highlights a range of concepts and tools I’ve mastered, with a strong emphasis on modern web development practices:

✨ **Project Highlights — Modern Web Development Practices**

► **HTML5:** Structured the application using semantic HTML5 tags to enhance accessibility and SEO.

► **CSS3:** Utilized custom CSS variables for theme management, applied gradients for visual appeal, implemented media queries for responsive design, and added subtle animations for a polished interface.

► **JavaScript (ES6+):** Developed the core application logic, ensured efficient event handling, and managed data flow robustly.

► **Chart.js:** Integrated dynamic and responsive pie chart visualizations for spending data with optimized performance.

► **Local Storage API:** Implemented client-side data persistence to securely store expenses, budgets, theme preferences, and currency settings offline.

► **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updated the user interface in real-time based on user interactions and data changes.

► **Event Listeners:** Handled multiple user interactions such as form submissions, button clicks, and dynamic content updates.

► **Responsive Design:** Achieved with a combination of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and adaptive media query breakpoints (768px, 480px).

► **Web Accessibility (A11y):**

* Correct usage of ARIA attributes (*role, aria-modal, aria-labelledby, aria-live*) for screen reader compatibility.
* Enhanced color contrast ratios for better readability across themes.
* Focus management for modals to maintain logical tab order and prevent focus trapping.

► **Performance Optimization:**

* Used the *defer* attribute for non-critical scripts to boost page load speed.
* Cached computed CSS styles to minimize forced reflows and enhance runtime performance.
* Embedded inline SVG icons to reduce HTTP requests and optimize image delivery.

► **Vercel Deployment:** Leveraged Vercel for seamless and efficient deployment, demonstrating strong understanding of modern CI/CD workflows.
