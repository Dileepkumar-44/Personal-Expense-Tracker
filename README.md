#Technologies Used
This project highlights a range of concepts and tools I’ve mastered, with a strong emphasis on modern web development practices:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 **Project Highlights — Modern Web Development Practices**

► **HTML5:** Structured the application using semantic HTML5 tags to enhance accessibility and SEO.

► **CSS3:** Utilized custom CSS variables for theme management, applied gradients for visual appeal, implemented media queries for responsive design, and added subtle animations for a polished interface.

► **JavaScript (ES6+):** Developed the core application logic, ensured efficient event handling, and managed data flow robustly.

► **Chart.js:** Integrated dynamic and responsive pie chart visualizations for spending data with optimized performance.

► **Local Storage API:** Implemented client-side data persistence to securely store expenses, budgets, theme preferences, and currency settings offline.

► **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updated the user interface in real-time based on user interactions and data changes.

► **Event Listeners:** Handled multiple user interactions such as form submissions, button clicks, and dynamic content updates.

► **Responsive Design:** Achieved with a combination of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and adaptive media query breakpoints (768px, 480px).

► **Web Accessibility (A11y):**

* Correct usage of ARIA attributes (*role, aria-modal, aria-labelledby, aria-live*) for screen reader compatibility.
* Enhanced color contrast ratios for better readability across themes.
* Focus management for modals to maintain logical tab order and prevent focus trapping.

► **Performance Optimization:**

* Used the *defer* attribute for non-critical scripts to boost page load speed.
* Cached computed CSS styles to minimize forced reflows and enhance runtime performance.
* Embedded inline SVG icons to reduce HTTP requests and optimize image delivery.

► **Vercel Deployment:** Leveraged Vercel for seamless and efficient deployment, demonstrating strong understanding of modern CI/CD workflows.

# Project Structure
**index.html:** The main HTML file, providing the overall structure of the application, including navigation, expense forms, summary, analytics, and expense list sections.

**styles.css:** Contains all custom CSS rules, defining theme variables, preloader animations, and comprehensive responsive styling for all components.

**script.js:** Houses the core JavaScript logic, managing expense data, handling user interactions, updating analytics, and controlling UI elements like the theme toggle and custom modals.

# Challenges & Solutions

**1. Performance Optimization (TBT, INP, Reflows):**

• **Challenge:** Initial Lighthouse audits revealed high **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**    and **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** during user interactions, indicating a           sluggish UI due to JavaScript execution and forced reflows. 

• **Solution:** Implemented the **defer** attribute for script loading to prevent           render blocking. Refactored JavaScript to cache computed styles and use                  **requestAnimationFrame** for DOM updates, reducing layout thrashing and improving        responsiveness. Replaced external image assets with **inline SVGs** to minimize           HTTP requests.

**2. Web Accessibility (A11y):**
• **Challenge:** Issues were found with **ARIA attribute usage** and **insufficient       color contrast**, affecting usability for assistive technologies and visually           impaired users.
• **Solution:** Enhanced color contrast for key text elements (e.g., `--text-secondary`) across both themes. Implemented proper **ARIA roles** (*dialog, aria-modal, aria-labelledby*) and **focus management** for the confirmation modal, ensuring full screen-reader accessibility. Added `aria-live="polite"` to dynamic message alerts.

**3. Chart Loading:**

• **Challenge:** Needed to ensure **Chart.js** loads efficiently and updates smoothly      without degrading performance.

• **Solution:** Dynamically loaded **Chart.js** with the **defer** attribute and           optimized chart re-rendering logic to update only when necessary, using **cached        theme colors**.

**4. Theme Consistency:**

• **Challenge:** Maintaining consistent visual design and readability across **light**    and **dark** modes.

• **Solution:** Used **CSS variables** (`:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]`) to define      theme-specific colors and properties, enabling seamless and consistent theme             switching.

**5. Data Persistence:**

• **Challenge:** Ensuring user data (expenses, budgets, and preferences) remained          persistent across sessions.

• **Solution:** Implemented the **Local Storage API** for robust offline data storage     and reliable session recovery.

**6. Responsiveness:**

• **Challenge:** Adapting the layout and functionality for a wide range of screen sizes   and devices.

• **Solution:** Designed with a **mobile-first approach**, leveraging **CSS Grid**,       **Flexbox**, and **media queries** to create a fully responsive and adaptive            interface.

# Future Improvements
• Add export/import functionality for data backup and migration.

• Implement bank sync or API integration for real-time transaction updates (requires backend development).

• Enhance analytics with more detailed reports, trend analysis over longer periods, and predictive insights.

• Add user authentication for multiple profiles and cloud synchronization of data.

• Explore advanced accessibility features for even broader inclusivity.
